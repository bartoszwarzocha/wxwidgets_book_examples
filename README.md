# wxWidgets Example Applications

## Introduction
This repository contains example applications demonstrating various features of [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/) library. These applications serve as part of additional materials for the book **"Cross-Platform Programming with C++ and wxWidgets 3"** by **Bartosz Warzocha**. The book can be found at:
[https://ksiegarnia.pwn.pl/Programowanie-wieloplatformowe-z-C-i-wxWidgets-3,750527898,p.html](https://ksiegarnia.pwn.pl/Programowanie-wieloplatformowe-z-C-i-wxWidgets-3,750527898,p.html)

All examples are licensed under the [wxWidgets License](https://www.wxwidgets.org/about/licence/).

The source code has been updated and tested on:
- **Windows 11** (Visual Studio 2022) with wxWidgets 3.3.x
- **Linux Mint 22** with wxWidgets 3.2.6

In every application folder you can find **Visual Studio solution & project** file, **Code::Blocks project** file and **makefile**, which allow you to build the app in every Windows or Linux OS.

_Additionally, all example applications have been fully translated into English. Originally, they were only available in Polish._

## Upgrade projects to your version of the wxWidgets: upgrade_wxwidgets.py

The `upgrade_wxwidgets.py` script allows automatic migration of wxWidgets versions in projects. It replaces references to older library versions with newer ones and updates Makefile configurations.

### Usage
1. Edit scirpt with your wxWidgets versions.
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python upgrade_wxwidgets.py
   ```
3. Enter the directory path containing the project files (`./`).
4. The script will automatically update all `.vcxproj`, `.sln`, and `Makefile` files.

## Directory Structure & Examples list

Here is a list of example apllications (as well as other add-ons) included in the repository.
- Note that some projects require additional files, which are usually placed in the Release_linux and Release_msw_x64 directories. If you are building the Debug version, you need to make sure that the additional files are also placed in the target directories.
- On some Linux distributions, it may be necessary to manually hardcode the Release_linux/obj and Debug_linux/obj directories before starting the build.
